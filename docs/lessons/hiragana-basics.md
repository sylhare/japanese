# Hiragana Basics

Hiragana is the foundation of Japanese writing. It's used for native Japanese words, grammatical particles, and verb endings. Learning hiragana is your first step toward reading Japanese.

## What is Hiragana?

Hiragana is a phonetic writing system where each character represents a syllable. It consists of 46 basic characters plus variations for voiced sounds and contracted sounds.

### Characteristics of Hiragana
- **Rounded shapes**: More flowing and curved compared to katakana
- **Phonetic**: Each character represents a specific sound
- **Essential**: Used in almost every Japanese sentence
- **Foundation**: Must be learned before kanji

1. あ → ?
2. か → ?
3. さ → ?

### Exercise 2: Romaji to Hiragana
Write the hiragana character for each romaji:

## Writing Practice

### Stroke Order
Each hiragana character has a specific stroke order:

1. **Top to bottom**: Start from the top
2. **Left to right**: Move from left to right
3. **Outside to inside**: For enclosed characters
4. **Horizontal before vertical**: For crossing strokes

### Practice Sheets
Create your own practice sheets by writing each character multiple times:

```
あ あ あ あ あ

う う う う う
え え え え え
お お お お お
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Confusing similar characters**:
   - ね (ne) vs れ (re)

   - は (ha) vs ほ (ho)

2. **Incorrect stroke order**: Always follow the proper stroke order
3. **Mixing up rows**: Remember which character belongs to which row
4. **Pronunciation errors**: Practice the correct pronunciation for each character
