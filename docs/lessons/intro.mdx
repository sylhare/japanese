## Understanding Japanese Grammar

### Basic Sentence Structure

Japanese follows a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) pattern:

**English**: I eat sushi.
**Japanese**: 私は寿司を食べます。
**Romaji**: Watashi wa sushi o tabemasu.
**Structure**: I (subject) sushi (object) eat (verb).

### Key Grammar Points

1. **Particles**: Small words that indicate grammatical relationships
    - は (wa) - topic marker
    - を (o) - object marker
    - に (ni) - direction/time marker

2. **Verb Conjugation**: Verbs change form based on tense, politeness, and meaning
    - Dictionary form: 食べる (taberu - to eat)
    - Polite form: 食べます (tabemasu - eat)
    - Past tense: 食べました (tabemashita - ate)

3. **Politeness Levels**: Japanese has different levels of formality
    - Casual: 食べる (taberu)
    - Polite: 食べます (tabemasu)
    - Honorific: 召し上がる (meshiagaru)
