# Linking Words

Linking words connect ideas and sentences together.
Mastering these small but powerful words will make your Japanese sound much more natural and expressive.

## Cause and Reason

Use these to explain *why* something happens.

| Hiragana | Kanji | Romaji | English | Type |
|----------|-------|--------|---------|------|
| から | - | kara | because, since (casual) | conjunction |
| ので | - | node | because, since (polite) | conjunction |
| だから | - | dakara | so, therefore | conjunction |
| そのため | その為 | sono tame | for that reason, therefore | conjunction |
| なぜなら | 何故なら | nazenara | because (formal explanation) | conjunction |

**Examples:**

- あめが ふっているから、いえに います。 — Because it's raining, I'm staying home.
  - *ame ga futte iru kara, ie ni imasu.*
- つかれたので、はやく ねました。 — Because I was tired, I went to bed early.
  - *tsukareta node, hayaku nemashita.*
- さむいです。だから、コートを きてください。 — It's cold. So please wear a coat.
  - *samui desu. dakara, kooto o kite kudasai.*

:::tip から vs ので
**から** is more casual and direct. **ので** is softer and more polite — prefer it in formal situations.
- さむいから... → direct, casual
- さむいので... → softer, polite
