### Comparison: My Family vs. Someone Else's Family

| | English | My Family | Someone Else's Family |
|--|---------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 | family | かぞく (kazoku) | ごかぞく (gokazoku) |
| 👨 | father | ちち (chichi) | おとうさん (otousan) |
| 👩 | mother | はは (haha) | おかあさん (okaasan) |
| 👴 | grandfather | そふ (sofu) | おじいさん (ojiisan) |
| 👵 | grandmother | そぼ (sobo) | おばあさん (obaasan) |
| 👨 | older brother | あに (ani) | おにいさん (oniisan) |
| 👩 | older sister | あね (ane) | おねえさん (oneesan) |
| 👨 | younger brother | おとうと (otouto) | おとうとさん (otouto san) |
| 👩 | younger sister | いもうと (imouto) | いもうとさん (imouto san) |
| 👨 | uncle | おじ (oji) | おじさん (ojisan) |
| 👩 | aunt | おば (oba) | おばさん (obasan) |
| 🤵 | husband | おっと (otto) | ごしゅじん (goshujin) |
| 👰 | wife | つま (tsuma) | おくさん (okusan) |
| 👦 | son | むすこ (musuko) | • ぼっちゃん (bocchan)<br />• むすこさん (musuko san) |
| 👧 | daughter | むすめ (musume) | • おじょうさん (ojou san)<br />• むすめさん (musume san) |

**Usage Examples:**
- When talking about YOUR family: かぞくは よにんです (kazoku wa yonin desu) - My family has four people
- When talking about YOUR family: ちちは はたらきます (chichi wa hatarakimasu) - My father works
- When talking about SOMEONE'S family: ごかぞくは おげんきですか？ (gokazoku wa ogenki desu ka?) - How is your family?
- When talking about SOMEONE'S family: おとうさんは いしゃですか？ (otousan wa isha desu ka?) - Is your father a doctor?
- Polite form 〜さま is more respectful than 〜さん and is used in very formal situations

## Cultural Notes

- In Japanese, you use different words when talking about your own family vs. someone else's family
- When talking about your own family, use humble forms (ちち, はは, あに, etc.)
- When talking about someone else's family, use polite forms (おとうさん, おかあさん, おにいさん, etc.)
- Family relationships are very important in Japanese culture and society
- The concept of 家 (ie) - household/family line - is significant in traditional Japanese culture
