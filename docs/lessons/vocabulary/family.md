| 👨 father          | ちち (chichi)   | おとうさん (otousan)                               |
| 👩 mother          | はは (haha)     | おかあさん (okaasan)                               |

| 👩 aunt            | おば (oba)      | おばさん (obasan)                                 |

| 👦 son             | むすこ (musuko)  | • ぼっちゃん (bocchan)<br />• むすこさん (musuko san)   |
| 👧 daughter        | むすめ (musume)  | • おじょうさん (ojou san)<br />• むすめさん (musume san) |

- Polite form 〜さま is more respectful than 〜さん and is used in very formal situations

- When talking about your own family, use humble forms (ちち, はは, あに, etc.)
- When talking about someone else's family, use polite forms (おとうさん, おかあさん, おにいさん, etc.)
- Family relationships are very important in Japanese culture and society
- The concept of 家 (ie) - household/family line - is significant in traditional Japanese culture
