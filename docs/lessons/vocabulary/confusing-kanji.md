# Confusing Kanji: How to Tell the Difference

Many Japanese kanji look very similar but have completely different meanings and pronunciations. Learning these confusing pairs together is the best way to remember their differences and avoid getting mixed up when reading or writing.

## Kanji with Different Stroke Lengths
